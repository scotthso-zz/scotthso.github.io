Out of sheer bordom, I decided to see who has the most GitHub commits from the community. It turns out that someone was one step ahead of me. 
       </div>
    
    <br>
    <h3>A fellow by the name of Paul Millr had compiled a <a href= "https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075">Gist</a> of the most active GitHub users of which he updates once a week. From the list, at this very day, the most active GitHub user is <a href="https://github.com/kevinsawicki">Kevin Sawicki</a> with 12405 commits. He is the genius who created the open source text editor, Atom. On occasion, he tops more than 200 commits in one day. Incredible. </h3>
    
    <h3>What's also really cool about the list that Paul made is that it shows where the users are from beside their names. So I decided to ctrl+f for someone from my hometown, Toronto. At number 63, <a href="https://github.com/markstory">Mark Story</a> has a fair 2900 commits. When I clicked his name, what absolutely blew me away was that his Public contributions bar was completely green. This guy coded every. Single. Day.</h3>
    
    <h3>When I read his blog, it seems like he did it to challenge himself, after being inspired by an article called <a href = "http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">write code ever=y day</a> by John Resig. He wanted to challenge himself and from that pick up a lot of good habits.</h3>
