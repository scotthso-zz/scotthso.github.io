     <h1>10 Things that I wish I had known in High School</h1>
    <p class="muted">18 August 2014</p>

  <div id = "post">
<div id = "beginning">

    Looking back at my High School career there are some things that I wish I had done or known. These are just for me personally and is based upon the type of person I want to be now.

</div>

<ul>
<li><b>Listen to your mom</b></li>
    <h3>No matter how absurd or how annoying the tip your mom gave you is. It is most likely going to benefit you in the future. </h3>
<li><b>Popularity isn't worth it</b></li>
<h3>In high school, almost everyone wants to be part of the "popular" group. Very often they try very hard and change who they truly are to be someone else. Popularity isn't worth it. When university comes around noone cares how popular you were in high school. </h3>
<li><b>Summer isn't play time</b></li>
<h3>I know school seems like a burden and summer is the only time to have fun. "I have to go on vacation during the summer" or "I have to be out everyday to enjoy the sun." I'm not advising you to stay indoors or to not go out and have good times wiht friends, but summer is a great time to do productive things. Such as building your own quadcopter, making short films, working ahead or making your own app.</h3>
<li><b>Try to be the smartest in every class</b></li>
<h3>You should get into the mentality that being average isn't good enough. You should always try to aim to be the smartest in every class. No matter how smart that one kid is in your class, who says you can't be like him? You've just got to work for it.</h3>
<li><b>Suck up to teachers</b></li>

<li><b>Get more hobbies</b></li>

<li><b>Don't take education for granted</b></li>

<li><b>When it's time to work it's time work</b></li>

<li><b>Don't be limited by your age</b></li>

</ul>
